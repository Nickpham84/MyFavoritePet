            <h1>Pikachu The Cockatiel</h1>
            <p>The cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), also known as miniature 
                cockatoo, weero, or quarrion, is a bird that is a member of 
                its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. 
                They are prized as household pets and companion parrots 
                throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. 
                As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only 
                to the budgerigar.</p>
            <p>The cockatiel is the only member of the genus Nymphicus. 
                It was previously considered a crested parrot or small 
                cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned 
                it to its own subfamily, Nymphicinae. It is, therefore, now 
                classified as the smallest of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). 
                Cockatiels are native to Australia, and favour the Australian 
                wetlands, scrublands, and bush lands.</p>
